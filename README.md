This is my writing project about false discovery rate methods in metabolomics. 

The structure is as follows: 
The proposal introduces the topic and suggests things I planned to do for the project before I started it. 
EM algorithm simulation was code given to me to show how the EM algorithm works and how it implement it. 
Data analysis is where I got the resutls from the data that I am not allowed to share. 
MHT_sim is a rough draft of some simulation study results that get used later in the writing and MHT_HPC script. 
MHT_HPC_script and Rtest.sbatch are scripts I used to use the HPC cluster at MSU to run simulations.
Results of those simulations are FNRplot, FDRplot, ... from the sim_data.csv that I made from those scripts.
WP_draft is a .Rmd that I used to generate the writing project in Overleaf, and that final writeup is called "A Bayesian MT approach to synovial fluid metabolomics".pdf and an associated presentation with the same name.
